# Reporting on Trans People 101

Based on a [series of Tweets](https://twitter.com/VanguardVivian/status/484539541752414210) by [@VanguardVivian](https://twitter.com/VanguardVivian).

Organized and turned into a PDF by [@duckinator](https://twitter.com/duckinator).


* Do not use a trans person's former name(s).
* "Assigned male at birth" and "assigned female at birth," not "born male" and "born female."
* Do not ask trans people about their genitals.
* Always use the correct pronouns, even when referring to someone's pre-transition self.
    * "Correct pronouns" means the pronouns _they_ consider correct _currently_, regardless of anyone else's thoughts or pronouns they may have used previously.
* If you do not know which pronouns should be used when when referring to somebody, use [singular they](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they) (this is _not_ specific to trans people). Do not try to guess somebody's pronouns.
* Focus your questions on how to improve trans people's lives, not on satisfying cis people's nosiness.
* "Trans"/"transgender" is an adjective, not a prefix.
    * This means you should use "trans woman" and "trans man", not "transwoman" and "transman."
    * Do not use phrases like "woman in a man's body" or "man in a woman's body."
* If you're accused of transphobia, do not get defensive.
    * Assume that trans people are correct when we claim transphobia. Try to understand and fix the problem.
* Donâ€™t use "women" interchangeably with "cis women."
    * An example of using "women" and "cis women" interchangeably: "Women get pregnant."
* "Trans" means your gender assignment was incorrect. It does not mean you "identify as a gender other than your birth sex."
* There are many genders, not just two. "Opposite gender" does not make sense, due to the gender binary being a fallacy.
* "Cis," Latin for "on this side," means your gender matches the one which you were assigned at birth.
* "Transmisogyny" is oppression specific to trans women.
* "Transphobia" is oppression of all trans people.
