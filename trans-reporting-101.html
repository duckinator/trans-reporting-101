<h1 id="reporting-on-trans-people-101">Reporting on Trans People 101</h1>
<p>Based on a <a href="https://twitter.com/VanguardVivian/status/484539541752414210">series of Tweets</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/VanguardVivian">@VanguardVivian</a>.</p>
<p>Organized and turned into a PDF by <a href="https://twitter.com/duckinator">@duckinator</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use a trans person's former name(s).</li>
<li>&quot;Assigned male at birth&quot; and &quot;assigned female at birth,&quot; not &quot;born male&quot; and &quot;born female.&quot;</li>
<li>Do not ask trans people about their genitals.</li>
<li>Always use the correct pronouns, even when referring to someone's pre-transition self.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Correct pronouns&quot; means the pronouns <em>they</em> consider correct <em>currently</em>, regardless of anyone else's thoughts or pronouns they may have used previously.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you do not know which pronouns should be used when when referring to somebody, use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they">singular they</a> (this is <em>not</em> specific to trans people). Do not try to guess somebody's pronouns.</li>
<li>Focus your questions on how to improve trans people's lives, not on satisfying cis people's nosiness.</li>
<li>&quot;Trans&quot;/&quot;transgender&quot; is an adjective, not a prefix.
<ul>
<li>This means you should use &quot;trans woman&quot; and &quot;trans man&quot;, not &quot;transwoman&quot; and &quot;transman.&quot;</li>
<li>Do not use phrases like &quot;woman in a man's body&quot; or &quot;man in a woman's body.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you're accused of transphobia, do not get defensive.
<ul>
<li>Assume that trans people are correct when we claim transphobia. Try to understand and fix the problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Donâ€™t use &quot;women&quot; interchangeably with &quot;cis women.&quot;
<ul>
<li>An example of using &quot;women&quot; and &quot;cis women&quot; interchangeably: &quot;Women get pregnant.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Trans&quot; means your gender assignment was incorrect. It does not mean you &quot;identify as a gender other than your birth sex.&quot;</li>
<li>There are many genders, not just two. &quot;Opposite gender&quot; does not make sense, due to the gender binary being a fallacy.</li>
<li>&quot;Cis,&quot; Latin for &quot;on this side,&quot; means your gender matches the one which you were assigned at birth.</li>
<li>&quot;Transmisogyny&quot; is oppression specific to trans women.</li>
<li>&quot;Transphobia&quot; is oppression of all trans people.</li>
</ul>
